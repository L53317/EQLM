This folder contains the models and necessary data of the FESTIP-FSS5 ascent vehicle. The models were taken from [1] and are contained inside the script models_FESTIP.py.
The uncertainties implemented in the aerodynamic and atmospheric models were taken from [2].

The files crowd_cl.mat, crowd_cd, crowd_cm.mat, crowd_alpha.mat, crowd_mach.mat contains the aerodynamic coefficients used in the aerodynamic model. These are not di original
files used in [1] but a modified version produced in [3]. The file reference_trajectory.mat contains the reference trajectory produced in [3].
