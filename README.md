Strathclyde Mechanical and Aerospace Research Toolbox for Machine Learning

Please refer to the subfolder for detailed explanation of the algorithmsn namely
* Extreme Q-Learning Machine (EQLM) is a Q-learning algorithm which performs network weight updates using ELM. Specifically, the upgrade mechanism is an incremental form of ELM referred to as LS-IELM. Example of the application of the learning scheme to the cart pole system provided.
* Genetic Programming algorithm for the intelligent control of launch vechiles. Example of the application of the algorithm to the Goddard problem provided
