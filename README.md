Strathclyde Mechanical and Aerospace Research Toolbox for Machine Learning

Please refer to the subfolder for detailed explanation of the algorithms and their usage:
* **Extreme Q-Learning Machine (EQLM)** is a Q-learning algorithm which performs network weight updates using ELM. Specifically, the upgrade mechanism is an incremental form of ELM referred to as LS-IELM. Example of the application of the learning scheme to the cart pole system provided.
* **Genetic Programming (GP)** algorithm for the intelligent control of launch vehicles. Example of the application of the algorithm to the Goddard problem provided
* **NN+GP_Intelligent Control**
