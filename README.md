Strathclyde Mechanical and Aerospace Research Toolbox for Machine Learning

Please refer to the subfolder for detailed explanation of the algorithms and their usage:
* **Extreme Q-Learning Machine (EQLM)** is a Q-learning algorithm which performs network weight updates using ELM. Specifically, the upgrade mechanism is an incremental form of ELM referred to as LS-IELM. Example of the application of the learning scheme to the cart pole system provided.
* **Genetic Programming (GP)** Contains different variations of the Genetic Programming (GP) algorithm and different GP-based control schemes

The requirements.txt file can be used to install the libraries used in the smart-ml folder.
