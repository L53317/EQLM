# Genetic Progamming for Intelligent Control


## Description
The code contained in this directory is the one used to obtain the results presented on [1]. To reproduce the results run the
files "MAIN_CdScenario.py", "MAIN_GustScenario.py" and "MAIN_DensityScenario.py".

The developed code is based on the DEAP library and makes use of Genetic Programming to evaluate online a control law for a 
Goddard Rocket test case in 3 different failure scenarios.


## Main libraries used (Python):
  * DEAP: https://github.com/deap/deap
  * Scipy
  * Numpy
  * Matplotlib
  * Multiprocessing
