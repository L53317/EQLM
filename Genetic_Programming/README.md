# Genetic Programming

Algorithms for the intelligent control of launch vehicles using primarly Genetic Programming along with other Machine Learning techiniques.

Please refer to the subfolder for detailed explanation of the algorithms and their usage:
* **IC_Goddard** contains the algorithm developed for the work presented in reference [1]. It is an implementation of the online use of GP to perform intelligent control applied on the Goddard ascent vehicle.
* **IC_NN_FESTIP** contains the algorithm developed for the work presented in reference [2]. It is an implementation of the online use of a NN to optimize online a control law produced using GP tp perform intelligent control. It is applied on the FESTIP ascent vehicle.
