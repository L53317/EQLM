# EuroGP 2021 

This folder contains the scripts used to produce the results presented at EuroGP21 [1].

To obtain the IGP results run the script Main_IGP.py, while for the SGP run the script Main_SGP.py. The chosen benchmark has to be set inside these two scripts. 

The script visualize_results.py plots the obtained results in the same format used in [1].
