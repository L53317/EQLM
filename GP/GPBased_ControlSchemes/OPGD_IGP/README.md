# Operator Gradient Descent Inclusive Genetic Programming

This folder contains the code used for the paper [1]. It uses a GP algorithm composed by the OPGD approach applied to the IGP. 
It can perform the real value parameters optimization furing the GP evolutionary process. It cannot be considered 
intelligent control.

To reproduce the results in [1], run the *mainIGPadjoint_oscillator.py* script for the harmonic oscillator, and the 
*mainIGPadjoint_pendulum.py* script for the inverted pendulum test case.
