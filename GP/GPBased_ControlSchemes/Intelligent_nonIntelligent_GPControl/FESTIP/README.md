# FESTIP-FSS5 control law generation with Genetic Programming

This folder contains the code developed for [1]. Please cite [1] if you use any part of this code. To reproduce the results, run
OfflineCreationGPLaw/IGP_OfflineLawCreation.py. 

The folder is structured as follows:
* Dataset: contains the uncertainty profiles used to generate the GP control laws
* FESTIP_Models: contains the aerodynamic data and reference trajectory for the ascent and reentry of the FESTIP
* OfflineCreationGPLaw: contains the IGP_OfflineLawCreation.py script which can be used to reproduce the results in [1].
