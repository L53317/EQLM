# Control law creation for Harmonic Oscillator and Inverted Pendulum using Genetic Programming

This folder contains the code developed for [1]. It represent a non intelligent control application of GP to design the
control law of an harmonic oscillator and an inverted pendulum on a cart. 

*mainIGP_oscillator.py* can be used to generate the control law for the harmonic oscillator.

*mainIGPpendulum.py* can be used to generate the control law for the inverted pendulum.

*functionsIGP.py* contains some functions used by the IGP.
