# Genetic Programming Algorithms

This folder contains different formulations of the GP algorithm

* **IGP** (Inclusive Genetic Programming) contains the new GP heuristic introduced in [1] and more thoroughly analyzed in [2].
*  **SGP** (Standard Genetic Programming) contains a standard implementation of GP used to compare the results of the IGP.
